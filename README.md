# Basic expressions calculator

This is an algorithm for calculate many operations at the same time, at the last update is not possible to use parenthesis.

So an example could be:

````
12+2-3+12/2*5
````
The result would be
````
--- Details ---
2*5: 10
12/10: 1.2
12+2: 14
-3+1.2: -1.8
14-1.8: 12.2
--- Done ---
The result is: 12.2
````
As we can see the details displayed, the expression is resolved in order of "Math Order of Operations":

1. Multiplication
2. Division
3. Addition
4. Subtraction

This respository will be updated on the way of my learning path. So I'll be adding features or improvements.
